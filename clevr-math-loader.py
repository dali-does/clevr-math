CLEVR-Math is a dataset for compositional language, visual and mathematical reasoning. CLEVR-Math poses questions about mathematical operations on visual scenes using subtraction and addition, such as "Remove all large red cylinders. How many objects are left?". There are also adversarial (e.g. "Remove all blue cubes. How many cylinders are left?") and multihop questions (e.g. "Remove all blue cubes. Remove all small purple spheres. How many objects are left?").
